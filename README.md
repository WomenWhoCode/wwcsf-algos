### 2b. Video Lectures

1. [Harvard CS50 Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW).

   - Recommended: [Lecture 3 - Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykrlqbV9wM&list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW&t=0s) and [Lecture 5 - Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW&t=0s)

2. [Strong programming foundations from mycodeschool, YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEEsT7DkdVO_fkrBw0OTrA).

   - This channel simplify the core fundamental computer programming concepts and creatively use illustaions to walk through the examples.

3. [Algorithms Course by Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IAPZzGSbME&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O).

   - In this beginner friendly course, Abdul covers algorithms as a subject, writes all the concepts on whiteboard provides ample example codes and explains concepts along the way.

     - This video series consists of 10 x Sections in total and has total 89 vidoes.
     - The topics covered are the basics of Algorithms, frequency of count method, time complexity, recurrsion, binary search, various sorting algorithms, greedy method, dynamic programming, graph trasversals, backtracking, branch and bound, and others.

   - This video series is beginner friendly and is great for all types of learners who come from various backgrounds including computer science students, self-learners to coding bootcamp students and gradudates.

### 2c. Free Courses

1.  [Coursera, Data Structures by UCSD](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/home/welcome)
2.  [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en): The tag line for this resource is "visualizing data structures and algorithms through animation". This is an incredible resource for any level of coder. Animations step through processes, and the explanations link to related topics, helping you synthesize your knowledge and build on previous undertstanding. The text is small and dense but it is well worth reading. Make sure to create an account to tailor your preferences and create a training plan.

### 2d. Articles

1.  [Wikiversity Data Structures and Algorithms](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms): Provides an overview of the Data Structure and Algorithms conceptual landscape. Recommended for its definitions of technical terms.
