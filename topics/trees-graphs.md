# Trees and Graphs

This is a more advanced topic that builds especially on [Linked Lists](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/wwcsf-algos/blob/master/topics/linked-lists.md). We recommend that you get comfortable with Linked Lists before tackling trees and graphs.

## Resources

### 1. Basics and terminology
* [Harvard CS50 2019 Data Structures lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&t=4104s) You can skip ahead to 1:09:32 for trees, but I recommend watching the lecture from the beginning. The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C. 
* Helpful list of terms and definitions from wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs
* Chapters from _Algorithms_ by Jeff Erickson:  
    * [Chapter 5: Basic Graph Algorithms](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/05-graphs.pdf)
    
### 2. Important procedures: traversal, heaps, search, etc.
* [William Fiset's youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P) explaining graph theory topics and algorithms. Not language specific.

* [Trees](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Trees/toctree.html) and [Graphs](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Graphs/toctree.html) from _Python DS_ by Brad Miller and David Ranum, code examples in Python
* [Binary Search Trees](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast014.html) from _Think Data Structures_  by Allen B. Downey, code examples in Java
* [Breadth-First Search](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-6/4) from _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Y. Bhargava, code examples in Python

### 3. Special topics
* Dijkstra's algorithm to find the Single-Source Shortest Path
    * [Chapter 7](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-7/1) from _Grokking Algorithms_ by  Aditya Y. Bhargava

## Problem Sets
* [Selected leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/list/?selectedList=xg9na7e1), mixed difficulty

* [Google Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/faq)   
Note: consider making an account on google kickstart and read through the FAQ's. There is a bit of a learning curve to test your code against their test data. Also, these problems are tricky! "Level 1" does NOT mean easy. That said, these problems are great learning opportunities. The "Analysis" pages are written by Google engineers and provide detailed discussion of brute-force vs. optimized approaches. Solutions are available from top scoring competitors around the world.
